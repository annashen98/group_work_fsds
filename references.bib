	abstract = {The past decade has seen the growth of Short-Term Lets (STLs) through Airbnb and other platforms. Measuring the scale of this activity is challenging as platforms appear unwilling to share data. Most research on Airbnb uses data from commercial sources but this raises issues of equity in access and transparency. Open data exist, but geographic and temporal coverage is limited. We consider whether these open data can be used to study the STLs sector, using a city in Scotland. Using 2017 data to construct: (i) property-level estimates of income; and (ii) through comparisons with rents in the long-term rental market, an area-level vulnerability index to identify neighbourhoods at greatest risk of properties switching from long-term to short-term renting. This index is strongly associated with the growth of Airbnb listings over two years. We conclude that open data can provide a valuable basis for research and policy. We discuss strategies for improving knowledge about this sector including through new data collection.},

	abstract = {Hedonic modelling techniques have frequently been used to examine real estate valuation, and they have recently started to be applied to short-term rental valuation. Relying on a web-scraped data set of all Airbnb transactions in New York City (NYC) between August 2014 and September 2016, this paper presents the first hedonic regression model of Airbnb to take into account neighbourhood effects and to predict both average price per night and revenue generated by each listing. The model demonstrates that locational factors – above all, transit accessibility to jobs – and neighbourhood variation have a large impact on both price per night and monthly revenue, and further reveals how professionalization of the short-term rental market is driving more revenue to a narrower segment of hosts. Further, the findings suggest that Airbnb hosts earn a significant premium by converting long-term housing in accessible residential neighbourhoods into de facto Airbnb hotels. This premium incentivizes landlords and hosts with properties in accessible neighbourhoods to replace long-term tenants with short-term guests, forcing those in search of housing to less accessible neighbourhoods.},
